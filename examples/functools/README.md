# Functional programming patterns in redun

This example shows how redun provides several builtin tasks for implementing common functional programming patterns. All the examples can be run by running:

```sh
redun run workflow.py main
```

Read through the comments of `workflow.py` for details on each pattern. Lastly, each builtin task is documented in `redun.functools`.
